# AngularCalculatorWebApp

Browser based calculator app created as a test project to experiment with Angular.

The app is responsive, and can calculate multiple opeartions on the same line (e.g. 10 + 10 - 5), but one key limitation is that it does not follow the BIDMAS order of operations. Implementing this would mean a significant refactor. 

This mini project is not hosted, but you can run it locally by installing the Angular CLI, forking and cloning the repo and running 'ng serve' in the terminal.
